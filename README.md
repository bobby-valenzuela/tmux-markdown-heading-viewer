# tmux-markdown-heading-viewer
A tmux plugin that allows you to interactively select a Markdown heading from a file and display the markdown content starting from that section in your terminal using `glow` without having to leave your tmux pane (or god forbid your terminal entirely).

Great for quick access to your obsidian vault.

## Installation

### Install using TPM

Put this in your configuration file,

```sh
set -g @plugin 'bobby-valenzuela/tmux-markdown-heading-viewer'
```

### Install manually using git

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kenos1/tmux-markdown-heading-viewer ~/clone/path
```

2. Put this line in your config

```sh
run-shell ~/clone/path/tmux-markdown-heading-viewer.tmux
```

3. Restart `tmux`

## Usage

The plugin provides two keybinds for interacting with your markdown files:

- `<prefix>+m`: Use the previously selected folder to choose a markdown file and heading.
- `<prefix>+M`: Select a new folder (starting from `/home/`), then choose a markdown file and heading.

Both keybinds open a tmux popup where you can fuzzy search through folders, files, and headings using `fzf`.

## Configuration

Change the pager by changing your `PAGER` environment variable. This means adding this to your shell config:

```sh
export PAGER="less"
```
